## User Stories

- in the list/board view, I would like to click and drag each task to rearrange the order and to add them to the tasklist when dropped.

## Features to add

- Maybe add comments to tasks
- In projects list view, group tasks by sections
- In projects board view, group tasks by status or by section name
  - Show the task's section name in the card if it is by status
